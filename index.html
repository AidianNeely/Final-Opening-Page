    <p> Hi, my name is Aidian Neely. This is a website (In Case You Didn't Notice). It's About My Coding Projects. <br>
      One purpose of this website (Besides the fact that it's my final) is to encourage younger people or even older people to try coding. <br>
   I explain this more in detail in the 
      <a href = "https://aidianneely.github.io/Final-About./">About</a>
      section. I hope in some way that you benifit from this webstie or if you don't then maybe you could suggest some ways on how I could improve it. <br>
      Feel free to shoot me an email if you have any suggestions. Thanks! Enjoy! <br>
    -Aidian Neely, Head (And Only), Programmer Of This Website.

      <p> Overview Of Computer Science Class: <br>
     This class had personally taught me to do things I've only ever seen the final results of. For example, being able to create websites like this in a matter of a few days is something I used to never imagine being able to do. Now I know how to make websites, basic games, and other cool things with code. <br>
      The main compiler we used this year was 
        <a href = "openprocessing.org"> Open Proccessing</a>. 
        Open Proccessing is a compiler accessiable from pretty much any device you can imagine. The requirements are a search engine and an account. By having these to things you can create and view amazing and creative projects made by others or yourself. So I would reccomend going and getting an account and starting your own project. <br>
        We also covered different counting bases. Such as base 2 (binary), base 3 (trinary), and base 16 (hexadecimal). We eventually came to the end of the semester and started learning about web programming. I instantly knew I wanted to do my final on this and here I am. We used 
        <a href = "https://github.com/"> github</a>
        as our compiler for our HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript code.
